# Image Encoding for CNN-based 3D Action Recognition
The source codes for ICME2017 Competition paper ["Investigation of Different Skeleton Features for CNN-based 3D Action Recognition"- Zewei et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.00835).


All the codes used are released. 

The codes have not been well organized and commented.

The main file is "main_NTU.m".

The files "transform_*" refer to the color-encoding methods.

The files "extract_*" refer to the spatial features.
